what you have learned,
1.I learned how to use github better. I didn't know you could clone your repository to you own pc and use cmd to do things with it. I tought you had to do it github itself

what you found difficult to understand,
2.using the windows cmd to work with github it was really confusing at the beginning but made it worked. Also im still confused on how to commit changes from the cmd I tried it and it said it didnt find any changes 
even though I used notepad to change what was written

what you found easy to understand and what you think may have made this easy for you,
3.As always the instruction were clear but sometimes I wasnt sure what you meant like what is the web editor in step 7 it would help to know exactly where to go or maybe just a image to know exactly what to press

what you believe you need to improve,
4.I think I need to improve my skills on how to naviguate on github cause right now I kinda confused by the CMD on windows.

what the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier,
5.Honestly just more direction and it was done at home so I couldnt really as questions in class.

what you could have done to make the learning easier, and
6.It would have been easier if I didn't forget about it and start doing it last minute and was rushing it.

other reflections that you find relevant to your personal development.
7.Reflection I find relevant to myself is to spend more time on windows cmd to get used to it

some commands on windows cmd were (cd ...) this was used to go to the exact location of a folder
commands starting with git was to do thing on githubs like commit/push/clone

we also did a bit of python but it was something we already did in lab 2 it was pritting hello word.
