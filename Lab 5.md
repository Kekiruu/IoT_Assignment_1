what you have learned,

1. Connecting to a esp32 and how to flash it, writting a micropython code to make the esp32 to handle wifi and running a simple web on esp32

what you found difficult to understand,

2. it was only difficult when I decided to skip instructions and not read them like Im supposed to ,but when I did everything work well.
also didn't know I had to do sudo usermod -a -G dialout student() before flashing the esp32 until my teamate told me.

what you found easy to understand and what you think may have made this easy for you,

3. Same thing then the usual it was just following the instuction and it was pretty clear so I didn't have much issues with it except for the line of code I was missing.

what you believe you need to improve,

4. Nothing for this lab

what the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier,

5. I was sick again this week so I did at home instead, being able to ask you questions would have made some part easier. I could have mio but I forgot and just remembered I could have done that as im writting this reflection.

what you could have done to make the learning easier, and other reflections that you find relevant to your personal development.

6. Not getting sick and being able to attend class, except for that not much for this lab

/////////////////////////////////////////////
sudo usermod -a -G dialout student()  #\allowing us to dialout

pip install esptool #flashing the esp32

we copied a code to make wifi work all we had to do was changing the SSID and PASSWORD line.

For the webpage It worked just had to change the Ip adress and make sure its on the same network.
