what you have learned

1.I learned how to use RPI pins and how the coding works for it and how class and objects work by using the count and index variable.

what you found difficult to understand,

2.Not much except for the class the objects but even those where quick to understand, the logic was the same then arduino and we did somethign similar before already so it wasnt that complicated I just had to get used to python language

what you found easy to understand and what you think may have made this easy for you,

3.How to use the pins and how to call them. its really simalar to arduino on how you do it so it was really simple to comprehend.

what you believe you need to improve,

4.getting used to reading python.For the most part I dont have a issue with it but sometimes I do need to google what some stuff do.

what the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier,

5.Not much, I was sick that day so I had to do it at home and it still worked. Had a bit of issues with the last part but it was simple to fix

what you could have done to make the learning easier

6.same thing then before this lab was really straight foward and enjoyable to do.

other reflections that you find relevant to your personal development.

7.Nothing for this lab

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

and for the line of codes we learned:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO   #this is to import the library to be able to use RPI

GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)  #For setting up pin to be Input or outputs

GPIO.output(pin, int(bin_str[2-i]))  #Activating the pins

GPIO.cleanup()  #cleaning up

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) # use BCM Pin Numbering
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
