Designing and programming our MQTT-driven robot car was a long process with many steps and challenges, but I was very proud of the result.

The first step was to figure out what the project was going to look like hardware-wise. From the get-go, I wanted the hardware side of the project to be as quick and easy as possible, while still yielding a cool, tangible final result. I like projects that I can see and touch, but this project is really about software, so I wanted us to be able to focus all of our efforts there. We decided that for the physical device, we would re-use the old Elegoo robot car from the first semester, since it had everything that we need for a microcontroller to control motors & sensors, in a familiar and reliable package. I happen to have laying around an ESP8266 board that is shaped exactly like an Arduino Uno, so my original idea was to just plug that ESP board into the robot's shield meant for an Arduino Uno, to securly connect the ESP's IO pins to the robot components. Unfortunately though, the pinout of this ESP board is not the same as the pinout that the shield is designed for, so plugging it into the shield would cause power pins to get shorted. The next option was to take advantage of the connection point on top of the shield for the Uno's UART pins. This allows us to leave the Arduino Uno in the robot, and have an ESP board commanding the arduino via their RX and TX pins. This made for a very easy hardware implementation, since we just have to use a mini ESP8266 board with its RX and TX connected to the Uno's TX and RX, plus VCC and GND, and all the rest of the wiring is already done.
