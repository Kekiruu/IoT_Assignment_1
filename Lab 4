what you have learned,
1.I learned how to use RPI pins and how the coding works for it

what you found difficult to understand,
2.Nothing at all, the logic was the same then arduino and we did somethign similar before already so it wasnt that complicated I just had to get used to python language

what you found easy to understand and what you think may have made this easy for you,
3.How to use the pins and how to call them. its really simalar to arduino on how you do it so it was really simple to comprehend.

what you believe you need to improve,
4.getting used to reading python.For the most part I dont have a issue with it but sometimes I do need to google what some stuff do.

what the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier,
5.Not much, I was sick that day so I had to do it at home and it still worked. Had a bit of issues with the last part but it was simple to fix
